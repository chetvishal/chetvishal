### Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Vishal Singh 

I am a driven software engineer and a life-long learner. My expertise is in front-end development, with a focus on React and javascript. I have worked on many projects where I have used various technologies and frameworks like jwt tokens, node.js, typescript, redux, and many more.

I also have experience working on mobile apps using kotlin and react native.
